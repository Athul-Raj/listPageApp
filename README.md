Assignment- Implementing List view with pagination in it.



Develop a list page where you hit api and get results .
At a time only 21 properties will come. And when u reach at end of list you will call api by increasing page number.
Then you have to develop a filter screen where if u apply filters then accordingly it will change results.


API with page number 1(first time)-- http://www.nobroker.in/api/v1/property/filter/region/ChIJLfyY2E4UrjsRVq4AjI7zgRY/?lat_lng=12.9279232,77.6271078&rent=0,500000&travelTime=30&pageNo=1

then second time increase page number 
http://www.nobroker.in/api/v1/property/filter/region/ChIJLfyY2E4UrjsRVq4AjI7zgRY/?lat_lng=12.9279232,77.6271078&rent=0,500000&travelTime=30&pageNo=2

filters will be
&type=BHK3/BHK4/BHK2
&buildingType=AP/IH/IF
&furnishing=FULLY_FURNISHED/SEMI_FURNISHED
